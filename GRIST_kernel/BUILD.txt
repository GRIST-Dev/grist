Compiling parallel version of GRIST:

Requirements:
(1) The METIS library (built with 32 bits data type, i.e. IDXTYPEWIDTH = 32 (the default), since the input data of the node 
    indices are of type integer(4) in GRIST)
(2) The NetCDF library
(3) The PnetCDF library
(4) The Lapack library
All the external libraries should be built with the same C, Fortran, and CXX compilers of those building GRIST.

Recommended lib versions are:
lapack-3.8.0  
metis-5.1.0  
netcdf-3.6.3  
pnetcdf-1.12.2
intel compiler&mpi 2018

Make the following changes to the build.sh:

Modify NETCDF, PNETCDF, LAPACK, and METIS to specify your Netcdf, PnetCDF, Lapack, and METIS lib directories. Modify EXEDIR 
to specify the directory for the target binary executable of GRIST. Then modify FC to specify the Fortran compiler. 
After the modifications, type

$ ./build.sh ${model}  

to finish building of GRIST. 

If sucessfully done, one should have two executable binaries: ${model}.exe and partition.exe.
